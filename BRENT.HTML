            <h4>HOBBIES</h4>
            <p> <center>
                Gaming - I am really into gaming since i was a little kid. I played a lot of games until now <br>
                I still play online games with my friends and still having that "fun" I used to have. Gaming saves<br>
                me from boring moments and I always try to play competitively. <br>
                <br>
                Drawing - Since I love gaming I used to draw the characters and sometime designing my own. <br>
                I love to draw animated characters when I was a kid and I still do it sometimes when I want to. <br>
                It makes me proud when I draw a good one.<br>
                <br>
                Music - I love to listen to music when doing something because it does give relaxation to my brain. <br>
                I am literally listening to music while typing this and doing this whole html thing for my exam. <br>
                <br>
                Movies - I am a movie person I love to spent my free time to rest and watch some good movies or series <br>
                that got my interest. I watched a lot and I still watched those sequel that I followed for years.
